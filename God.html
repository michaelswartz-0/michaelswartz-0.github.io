        The origins of life and the universe are unknown, though we have some ideas. Spontaneous Generation was taken as a fact until Pasteur disproved it. We should start with the assumption that all things have precise causal explanations which are knowable, though they may be incomplete or contain errors, because this has always been true, and the only other option is to assume that there is an invisible barrier preventing us from knowing certain things, which we have no evidence for.
